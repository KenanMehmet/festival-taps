At a festival there is a queue of people to fill up their water bottles at the taps. 

Here there will be functions that will take two inputs.

An array of integers that will repersent different people and the size of their water bottles. [400, 750, 1000] e.g

An integer which represents the number of taps at the festival available for people to uyse for filling up thgeir water bottles.

To run the code, load up the python code into a IDE and run as a python file.

To insert different kinds of test data, the test_data.py includes all the different types of test data I had used for my programs, for the inital function, data validation, and the different flow rate of the taps. The water bottles must be in a list format, and the taps must be an integer, or for different flow rate of the taps, a list holding the flow rate of each tap and the number of entries in that list represent the taps.
